## Description
This project explores two approaches to solving Sudoku puzzles: Backtracking and Simulated Annealing. You can either enter a puzzle manually or generate one with customizable difficulty. Then, choose your preferred algorithm and watch it solve the board—while tracking the solving time and, for simulated annealing, the number of iterations. It’s a practical comparison between a guaranteed solution and a smart, AI-inspired heuristic.
